This is an c++ mex and Matlab 2013 implement of paper "Rectangling Panoramic Images via Warping", SIGGRAPH 2013

We use the code of "Lsd: A fast line segment detector with a false detection control", 
which is mentioned in the paper as reference code. 
http://www.runmycode.org/companion/view/224 
The test cases are the images in the auther's project page. 
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kahe/sig13/index.html

You can test all by "runAll.m" The test cases can be changed by changing the nameset. 
Be sure to make the blank of your test case(pixels without value in panorama) to be all white(near 255).

Enjoy the code!
